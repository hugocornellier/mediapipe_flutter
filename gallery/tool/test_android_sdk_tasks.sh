# Runs the official Android SDK task tests on an emulator, CPU only: Face and
# Hand Landmarker; Pose, Gesture and Holistic; Face and Object Detector and
# Image Classifier; Image Embedder; Image Segmenter; the text and audio tasks;
# then every live tile and the gallery journey through the sidebar. They run as
# sdk_all_test.dart, one app launch as on Test Lab: each extra install and
# launch was another chance for a hosted emulator to lose its Dart Development
# Service or die outright.
#
# The emulator's SwiftShader GL accepts a GPU task, then TFLite's GL delegate
# fails on the first frame, so GPU stays a phone check. `flutter test`
# installs the app itself, so camera permission is granted while it runs;
# otherwise the live demo waits behind the permission prompt and gets no
# frames. Firebase Test Lab grants it the same way before launch.
