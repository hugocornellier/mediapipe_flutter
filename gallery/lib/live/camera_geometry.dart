///   sign depends on which way the lens faces.
/// - **Everything else** (macOS, Linux, Windows, web): frames already arrive
///   upright, so no rotation.

/// The result is passed straight to MediaPipe as `rotationDegrees`, which is
/// also clockwise, and to [PreviewTransform] so the overlay lands on the same
