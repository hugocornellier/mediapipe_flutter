// Every official SDK suite in one app launch: on Firebase Test Lab, where each
// device run counts against a small daily quota, and on the CI emulator, where
// each extra install and launch risked losing the emulator. Build with
// SDK_GPU=required on a physical device so a GPU refusal fails its test instead
// of being recorded.
// The live tiles run after the suites: they open the camera, which is dark in a
// device rack. The gallery journey comes last and opens every page the way a
// user does, through the sidebar.
// EmbeddingGemma, Proofreader and Summarizer join with SDK_MODERN_TEXT, which
// the Test Lab build sets: one phone execution covers every suite, while the
// CI emulator runs them as a launch of their own, since the generative models
// take minutes on an emulated CPU.
