# mediapipe_retrieval

Google's MediaPipe retrieval tasks for Dart and Flutter. Universal Embedder
turns text, images and audio into vectors in one embedding space; Semantic
Retriever indexes documents, images, audio and mixed records on the device and
finds the ones nearest a query. Every call runs Google's official MediaPipe
pipeline.

## Platforms

| Task | Class | Android | iOS | macOS arm64 | Linux x64 | Windows x64 | Web |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Universal Embedder | `UniversalEmbedder` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Semantic Retriever | `SemanticRetriever` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

The runtimes are Google's MediaPipe 1.1.0: its per-family retrieval C
library, which this package's build hook downloads and checks against its
SHA-256 on Android 9+, iOS 15+, macOS 14+, Linux and Windows, on the CPU; and
`@mediapipe/tasks-retrieval` 1.1.0 in browsers, on the GPU delegate. Google's
browser Universal Embedder creates a WebGPU device for itself and has no CPU
path
([UP-052](../../upstream-issues.md#up-052-the-browser-universal-embedder-runs-only-on-a-hardware-webgpu-adapter)),
so the capability queries offer browsers only the GPU, and only on a
hardware WebGPU adapter; there both tasks answer as the native library does.
Two more differences the browser runtime imposes: images and audio go in as
bytes and samples there, never as file paths, and the index stays in memory,
so `databasePath` is for the native platforms. In browsers the package fetches
the model itself, since Google's task reads a `modelAssetPath` as a file
([UP-051](../../upstream-issues.md#up-051-the-browser-universal-embedder-reads-modelassetpath-as-a-file-and-a-second-wasm-object-needs-the-loader-again)).

## Quick start

```dart
import 'package:mediapipe_retrieval/mediapipe_retrieval.dart';

Future<void> search() async {
  final embedder = await UniversalEmbedder.create(
    UniversalEmbedderOptions(model: RetrievalModels.embeddingGemma2TextVision),
  );
  final retriever = await SemanticRetriever.create(
    SemanticRetrieverOptions(embedder: embedder),
  );
  try {
    await retriever.insertDocument(
      'dog',
      'A dog chases a ball across the park on a sunny afternoon.',
      metadata: {'topic': 'animals'},
    );
    await retriever.insertDocument(
      'recipe',
      'Whisk the eggs with sugar, then fold in the flour to make the batter.',
      metadata: {'topic': 'cooking'},
    );
    final result = await retriever.retrieve('A puppy playing fetch.', limit: 1);
    print('${result.records.first.id}: ${result.records.first.score}');

    final a = await embedder.embedText('A dog chases a ball.');
    final b = await embedder.embedText('A puppy plays fetch.');
    print(
      UniversalEmbedder.cosineSimilarity(
        a.embeddings.first,
        b.embeddings.first,
      ),
    );
  } finally {
    await retriever.dispose();
    await embedder.dispose();
  }
}
```

`retrieve` returns at most `limit` records scoring at least `minSimilarity`
(Google's default 0.5), best first, each with its id, text, score and
metadata; `metadataFilter` keeps only records carrying every given pair.
`retrieveContent` takes a multimodal query of `TextPart`, `ImagePart` and
`AudioPart`, and `insertImage`, `insertAudio` and `insertContent` index the
other modalities. A retriever runs on its embedder's worker: dispose it before
the embedder.

## Models

`RetrievalModels` pins Google's EmbeddingGemma 2 models with a vision encoder,
from Google's LiteRT community on Hugging Face (Apache 2.0): the text and
vision model (`embeddingGemma2TextVision`, 388 MB) and the full model with
audio (`embeddingGemma2`, 485 MB). Both embed into 768 dimensions. Google's
engine refuses the text-only EmbeddingGemma 2 for this task, so it is not
listed. An app bundles a model by naming it under
`hooks.user_defines.mediapipe_retrieval.models` in its pubspec and running
`dart run mediapipe_core:bundle_models`, or passes `modelPath` or
`modelBytes` of its own.

## Capabilities

`queryUniversalEmbedderCapabilities()` and
`querySemanticRetrieverCapabilities()` report, without loading a model, the
delegates this platform runs the tasks on: the CPU on Android, iOS, macOS,
Linux and Windows, and in browsers the GPU, once the plugin has registered
and on a hardware WebGPU adapter. The other delegate is refused by `create`
with a `RuntimeUnavailableException`: the native library's GPU path is not
validated, and Google's browser runtime has no CPU path.

## Testing

`dart test` runs the unit tests and, with Google's model downloaded by
`dart run tool/download_model.dart`, the native suite, which compares every
embedding and retrieval with the answers Google's own Python API gave
(`test/fixtures/embedding_gemma_2_text_vision_reference.json`, from
`tool/generate_reference.py` on the official mediapipe 1.1.0 wheel).
