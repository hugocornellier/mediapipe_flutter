# API parity

Checks the public API each family exports from
`package:mediapipe_<family>/mediapipe_<family>.dart`:

- **Parity.** The analyzer resolves the library twice, once with the native
  compilers' `dart.library.io`, `ffi` and `isolate`, once with the web
  compilers' `js_interop`, `js_util`, `html` and `js`, and diffs every public
  symbol and member. The two must be identical.
- **Conventions.** No platform type (`dart:ffi`, `dart:io`, `dart:js_interop`,
  `package:web`, ...) in a public signature; every task (a class with
  `static Future<Self> create`) has `Future<void> dispose()`, a `delegate`
  getter and a `query<Task>Capabilities()` function; every `*Options` class
  but `TaskOptions` and Gesture Recognizer's `ClassifierOptions` extends
  `TaskOptions`; no public name collides with `dart:core`, `dart:async`,
  `dart:typed_data`, `dart:collection`, `dart:math` or Flutter's foundation,
  services, widgets, material and cupertino libraries.
- **Snapshots.** `snapshots/<family>.txt` is the API dump; a
  `<family>.web.txt` exists only while the web API still differs. CI fails
  when a dump no longer matches, so every API change shows up in review.

`baseline.txt` lists the findings the API still has. The check fails on a
finding that is not in the baseline, and on a baseline entry that no longer
holds, so the baseline only shrinks deliberately.

```sh
cd tool/api_parity && dart pub get
dart run bin/api_parity.dart            # check
dart run bin/api_parity.dart --update   # rewrite baseline.txt and snapshots/
```

The four packages need `flutter pub get` first; the tool reads their package
configurations.
